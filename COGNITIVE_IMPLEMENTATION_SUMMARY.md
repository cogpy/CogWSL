### Key Classes and Interfaces

#### Core Cognitive Classes

### Cognitive Capabilities

#### Knowledge Representation
```cpp
// Atoms represent knowledge with uncertainty
auto concept = atomSpace->CreateAtom(Atom::Type::Concept, "ProcessEfficiency", 0.8f, 0.9f);
concept->SetAttention(0.7f);  // Attention for resource allocation

// Links connect related knowledge
concept->AddOutgoingLink(relatedMemory);
```

#### Agent Creation and Management
```cpp
// Create cognitive system
auto cognitiveSystem = std::make_unique<CognitiveSystem>();
cognitiveSystem->Initialize();

// Create specialized agents
auto optimizer = agentFactory->CreateAgent(AgentType::ProcessOptimizer, "MainOptimizer");
optimizer->Start();  // Begin autonomous operation

// Query system state
std::string status = integration->QueryCognitiveState("status");
```

#### Autogenetic Self-Modification
```cpp
// Agents automatically create rules from successful patterns
void CognitiveAgent::SelfModify() {
    auto successfulPlans = m_atomSpace->Query([](const Atom& atom) {
        return atom.GetType() == Atom::Type::Process && 
               atom.GetTruthValue() > 0.8f;  // High success rate
    });
    
    for (auto& plan : successfulPlans) {
        // Create new behavioral rule
        auto rule = m_atomSpace->CreateAtom(Atom::Type::Rule, 
                                           "Rule:" + plan->GetName(),
                                           plan->GetTruthValue(), 
                                           plan->GetConfidence());

}

// System events inform cognitive reasoning  
void OnSystemEvent(const std::string& eventType, const std::string& data) {
    g_cognitiveIntegration->OnSystemEvent(eventType, data);
    // Agents update their understanding and goals
}
