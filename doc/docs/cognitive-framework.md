# OpenCog Cognitive Architecture for WSL

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of OpenCog cognitive architecture as an autogenetic framework within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The cognitive framework enables autonomous, self-modifying AI agents to operate within the WSL environment, providing intelligent system management and optimization capabilities.

## Architecture Components

### Core Cognitive Architecture

#### Atom System
The foundation of the cognitive system is based on OpenCog's atomic knowledge representation:

- **Atom**: Fundamental unit of knowledge with truth values, confidence levels, and attention values
- **AtomSpace**: Global knowledge repository managing the graph of cognitive knowledge
- **Types**: Concept, Link, Process, Agent, Rule, Goal, Memory

#### Truth Values and Uncertainty
Each atom maintains:
- Truth value (0.0 to 1.0): Degree of belief in the atom's truth
- Confidence (0.0 to 1.0): Certainty in the truth value assessment
- Attention (0.0 to 1.0): Current focus level for resource allocation

### Cognitive Agents

#### Agent States
Cognitive agents operate in multiple states:
- **Inactive**: Agent is not processing
- **Active**: Normal cognitive processing cycle
- **Learning**: Acquiring new knowledge or patterns
- **Planning**: Generating action sequences to achieve goals
- **Executing**: Performing planned actions
- **SelfModifying**: Modifying own behavior or structure
- **Error**: Error state requiring intervention

#### Cognitive Cycle
Each agent follows a continuous cognitive cycle:
1. **Perceive**: Gather information from the environment
2. **Reason**: Process and analyze perceived information
3. **Plan**: Generate action sequences based on goals
4. **Act**: Execute planned actions
5. **Learn**: Update knowledge based on experience
6. **SelfModify**: Occasionally modify behavior patterns (autogenetic capability)

### WSL Integration Layer

#### Integration Manager
The `CognitiveIntegrationManager` bridges WSL events with the cognitive system:

```cpp
// Process lifecycle events
void OnProcessCreate(const std::string& distroId, uint32_t processId, const std::string& command);
void OnProcessDestroy(const std::string& distroId, uint32_t processId, int exitCode);

// System events
void OnDistroEvent(const std::string& distroId, const std::string& eventType, const std::string& data);
void OnSystemEvent(const std::string& eventType, const std::string& data);
```

#### Process Monitoring
The `CognitiveProcessMonitor` creates cognitive representations of WSL processes:
- Tracks process behavior patterns
- Learns from process execution histories
- Creates cognitive atoms representing process knowledge

#### Agent Factory
The `AutogeneticAgentFactory` creates specialized agents for different WSL tasks:
- **ProcessOptimizer**: Optimizes process execution and resource usage
- **ResourceManager**: Manages system resources intelligently
- **SecurityAnalyzer**: Detects and prevents security threats
- **PerformanceMonitor**: Monitors system performance and detects anomalies
- **SystemLearner**: Learns system behavior patterns
- **AdaptiveScheduler**: Optimizes process scheduling

## Autogenetic Capabilities

### Self-Modification
Agents can modify their own behavior through:
- **Rule Creation**: Generating new behavioral rules based on successful patterns
- **Goal Adaptation**: Adjusting goals based on system needs
- **Knowledge Restructuring**: Reorganizing knowledge for better performance

### Learning and Adaptation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring system patterns
- **Behavioral Learning**: Adapting behavior based on outcomes
- **Predictive Modeling**: Anticipating system needs and changes

## Configuration and Usage

### Initialization
```cpp
// Initialize the cognitive system
auto cognitiveIntegration = std::make_unique<CognitiveIntegrationManager>();
cognitiveIntegration->Initialize();

// Create specialized agents
auto factory = std::make_unique<AutogeneticAgentFactory>(cognitiveIntegration);
auto optimizer = factory->CreateAgent(AgentType::ProcessOptimizer, "MainOptimizer");
auto monitor = factory->CreateAgent(AgentType::PerformanceMonitor, "SystemMonitor");
```

### Querying Cognitive State
```cpp
// Query system status
std::string status = cognitiveIntegration->QueryCognitiveState("status");

// Query specific information
std::string processes = cognitiveIntegration->QueryCognitiveState("processes");
std::string agents = cognitiveIntegration->QueryCognitiveState("agents");
```

### Configuration Parameters
```cpp
// Configure cognitive system
cognitiveIntegration->SetCognitiveConfiguration("max_agents", "10");
cognitiveIntegration->SetCognitiveConfiguration("attention_update_interval", "1000");
cognitiveIntegration->SetCognitiveConfiguration("self_modification_probability", "0.01");
```

## Security Considerations

### Self-Modification Constraints
- **Safe Modifications Only**: Agents can only modify behavior within predefined safe boundaries
- **Rollback Capability**: Failed modifications can be reverted
- **Audit Trail**: All self-modifications are logged for security review

### Isolation and Sandboxing
- Cognitive agents operate within WSL's existing security model
- Process isolation prevents agents from affecting critical system components
- Resource limits prevent runaway cognitive processes

### Trust and Validation
- Agent actions are validated against system policies
- Trust levels are maintained for different types of modifications
- Critical system changes require human approval

## Performance and Resource Management

### Attention Economics
- Limited attention resources are allocated based on importance
- Attention spreads through linked concepts in the knowledge graph
- Attention decay prevents unbounded memory growth

### Memory Management
- Automatic cleanup of old memories and low-attention atoms
- Hierarchical knowledge organization for efficient access
- Periodic garbage collection of unused cognitive structures

### Computational Load Balancing
- Cognitive processing is distributed across multiple agents
- Processing cycles can be paused during high system load
- Agent activation is balanced based on system resources

## Integration with WSL Components

### Service Integration
The cognitive framework integrates with WSL's service architecture:
```cpp
// In WSL service initialization
if (g_cognitiveIntegration) {
    g_cognitiveIntegration->Initialize();
}
```

### Message Passing
Cognitive messages are integrated with WSL's existing message system:
```cpp
enum class CognitiveMessageType : uint32_t {
    AgentCreated = 0x1000,
    AgentDestroyed,
    AtomCreated,
    AtomModified,
    SelfModification
};
```

### Event Handling
WSL events trigger cognitive processing:
- Process creation/destruction updates cognitive knowledge
- System events influence agent goals and behavior
- User actions provide feedback for learning algorithms

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Cognitive System Statistics
```cpp
struct SystemStats {
    size_t totalAgents;
    size_t activeAgents;
    size_t totalAtoms;
    double averageAttention;
    std::chrono::milliseconds uptime;
};
```

### Integration Statistics
```cpp
struct IntegrationStats {
    size_t processesMonitored;
    size_t eventsHandled;
    size_t cognitiveAgents;
    size_t activeQueries;
    std::chrono::milliseconds averageResponseTime;
};
```

### Debugging and Logging
- Cognitive events are logged through WSL's logging system
- Agent state changes are tracked for debugging
- Knowledge graph can be exported for analysis

## Future Extensions

### Advanced Learning
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Hybrid symbolic-connectionist architectures
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Goal-directed learning from system feedback
- **Transfer Learning**: Knowledge sharing between different WSL instances

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
- **Agent Communication**: Structured communication protocols between agents
- **Distributed Cognition**: Cognitive processing across multiple WSL instances
- **Collective Intelligence**: Emergent behavior from agent interactions

### Advanced Self-Modification
- **Code Generation**: Agents generating new code modules
- **Architecture Evolution**: Self-modifying system architecture
- **Goal Evolution**: Autonomous goal generation and modification
